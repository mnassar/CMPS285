			<p>
				This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of the field of computer graphics. These fundamentals have not changed much in the past few decades. 

				Although the fundamentals of computer graphics have not changed much in the past few decades,
				many aspects of computer graphics have changed. Graphics cards (GPUs) in particular have become
				very powerful and many software tools have become available for taking full advantage of this power.
				To work as a software developer in the computer graphics industry today, you would need to learn
				at least the basics of these tools.

					<h2> Introduction </h2>
					<p>		<strong> Computer graphics</strong>, broadly defined, is a set of methods for using computers to create and manipulate images. There are many applications of computer graphics including: 
					</p>	<ul>
					<li> entertainment (games,
						cinema, tv commercials and other advertising),
					</li> 
					<li> design (architectural, manufacturing, ...),
					</li>
					<li>visualization (medical, scientific, information),
					</li>
					<li> 	    simulation (training), and much more.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>	
					This course will look at methods for creating images that are defined on a rectangular pixel 
					grid. The word pixel stands for “picture element”. The coordinates of the grid are integers. For
					example, typical high definition images are 1920 × 1080.

				<h2> A bit of history </h2>
				<p>
					Up to the early 1990’s, it was relatively cumbersome to write graphics software. The standards
					for graphics software were limited and typically one would code up an algorithm from scratch. 
					Although many companies had developed specialized graphics hardware (GPU’s – graphical processing
					units), this hardware was difficult to use since it often required assembly language programming.
					New algorithms were typically implemented to run on the CPU, rather than GPU, and as a result
					they tended to be slow and impractical for typical users.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the big graphics companies at that time (SGI) built and sold workstations that were
					specialized for graphics. SGI developed an API called GL which had many libraries of common
					graphics routines. In 1992 SGI released a standard API called OpenGL which other hardware
					vendors could use as well.
					Microsoft followed with the  <a href=http://en.wikipedia.
					org/wiki/DirectX>DirectX</a> API shortly thereafter. DirectX is used in the ”X Box”. DirectX competes with OpenGL and has 				remained popular among many users especially those who work with Microsoft software.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="slide">
				<h2> OpenGL vs. WebGL </h2> 
				<p>
					OpenGL 1.0 is said to have a fixed function pipeline. "Fixed function" means that the library
					offers a limited fixed set of functions. You cannot go beyond that library. You cannot program the
					graphics hardware to do anything other than what OpenGL offers.
					Graphics card technology improved steadily from the mid 1990’s and beyond the emergence of
					industry leaders NVIDIA, ATI (now part of AMD) and Intel. However, to program a graphics card
					(GPU) to make the most use of its enormous processing potential, one still had to write code that
					was at the assembly language level. This was relatively difficult and not much fun for most people.
					In 2004, OpenGL 2.0 was released which allowed access to the graphics card using a high level
					C-like language called the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). Other ”shading languages” have
					been developed since then, and more recent versions of OpenGL have been released as well. 

					The most recent trend is WebGL (released in 2011) which is an API specific for graphics in web
					browsers. Google maps uses WebGL for example. There is a growing trend to introduce WebGL in
					”intro to graphics” courses. 
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="slide"> 
				<h2> Three.js </h2>
				<p>
					Three.js is a program using WebGL and a developer’s library. WebGL is an Application Program Interface - “API” for short - that controls the GPU. It is based on OpenGL ES, an API used in mobile devices, which in turn is based on OpenGL, an API for desktop computers that dates back to 1992.
				</p>
				<p>
					WebGL is a state-based API: you set up exactly how you want the GPU to do something, then send it geometry to render under these conditions. This gives a pretty fine-grained control over the GPU, but can result in hundreds of lines of code to draw even the simplest scenes. This is why we’ll be using three.js, a free development library with many useful features. Just a few lines of code can create objects with materials, set up lighting and a camera, and even perform animation.

				<h2> Colors </h2>
				<p>
					The color of a pixel is defined by three numbers called RGB. These are the intensities of the
					red, green, and blue components. Typical images have 8 bits for each RGB value and hence 24 bits
					of intensity information per pixel i.e. values from 0 to 255. Here are some examples of colors:
				</p>
				<table border=10px >
					<tr> <td> (0,0,0)</td> <td> black </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> (255,255,255)</td> <td> white</td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> (255,0,0)</td> <td>red </td></tr>
					<tr> <td> (0, 0, 255)</td> <td>green </td></tr>
					<tr> <td> (0, 255, 0)</td> <td>blue </td></tr>
					<tr> <td> (255,255,0)</td> <td>yellow (red + green)</td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> (255,0,255)</td> <td>magenta (red + blue)</td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> (0,255,255)</td> <td>cyan (green + blue)</td> </tr>
				</table>
				<br/>
				<p>
					RGB space defines a cube: 

					<span class="latex">\{0, . . . , 255\}\times\{0, . . . , 255\}\times\{0, . . . , 255\}</span>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The above list of colors define
					the corners of the cube. There are many other colors (<span class="latex">256 \times 256 \times 256 = 2^24</span> ) with exotic names.</p>
					<p>

					<h2>Review of some basic linear algebra</h2>
					<h3>Dot product</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The length of <strong> 3D vector u </strong> is: 
							<div class="latex" align=center>
								\left | \mathbf{u} \right | = \sqrt{u_x^2+u_y^2+u_z^2} 
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							The dot product (or ”scalar product”) of two 3D vectors <strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong> is defined to be:
							<div class="latex" align=center>
								\mathbf{u}.\mathbf{v}  = u_x.v_x+u_y.v_y+u_z.v_z 
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							A more geometric way to define the dot product is to let θ be the angle between these two
							vectors, namely within the 2D plane spanned by the vectors. Then
							<div class="latex" align=center>
								\mathbf{u}.\mathbf{v}  = \left | \mathbf{u} \right | . \left | \mathbf{v} \right | \cos(\theta) 
							</div>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						It may not be obvious why these two definitions are equivalent, in general. The way I think
						of it is this. Take the case that the vectors already lie in a plane, say the xy plane. Suppose <strong>u </strong>
						= (1,0,0) and <strong> v </strong>= (cos θ, sin θ, 0). In this case, it is easy to see that the two definitions of dot
						product given above are equal. As an exercise: why does this equivalence holds in general?
					</p>

					<h2>Review of some basic linear algebra</h2>
					<h3>Cross product</h3>
					<p>The cross product of two 3D vectors <strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong> is written <strong>u × v</strong>. The cross product is a 3D vector that is perpendicular to both <strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong>, and hence to the plane spanned by <strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong> in the case that these two vectors are not parallel.
						Given two vectors <strong>u</strong> and <strong>v</strong>, the cross product <strong>u × v </strong>is usually defined by taking the 2D determinants of ”co-factor” matrices:
					</p>
					<div class="latex" align=center>
						\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
						u_x\\ 
						u_y\\ 
						u_z
						\end{bmatrix}
						\times 
						\begin{bmatrix}
						v_x\\ 
						v_y\\
						v_z 
						\end{bmatrix}
						= \begin{bmatrix}
						u_yv_z-u_zv_y\\ 
						u_zv_x-u_xv_z\\
						u_xv_y-u_yv_x 
						\end{bmatrix} 
					</div>
					<p>
						Exercise: find matrix M such that <strong>u × v </strong> is equal to the matrix-vector product M<strong>v</strong>. What is the rank of this matrix? 
					</p>

					<h2> Computing the normal of a triangle </h2>
					<p> 
						A key application for the cross product is to compute a vector normal to a planar surface such as
						a triangle or more generally a polygon. 

						Let the vertices
						be <span class="latex"> \mathbf{p}_0, \mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2</span> and assume we are looking at the triangle from a direction so that these vertices go counter-clockwise. We will define the surface normal (perpendicular) such that it points into the half space containing us (the viewer).
					</p>
					<p>
						Let <span class="latex">\mathbf{e}_0</span> denote the vector <span class="latex">\mathbf{p}_1 - \mathbf{p}_0</span>, i.e. the vector from 
						<span class="latex">\mathbf{p}_0</span> to <span class="latex">\mathbf{p}_1</span> , and let 
						<span class="latex">\mathbf{e}_1</span> denote the vector <span class="latex">\mathbf{p}_2-\mathbf{p}_1</span> Then the outward surface normal (pointing toward the viewer) is defined
						by: 
						<div class="latex" align="center">
							\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{e}_0 \times \mathbf{e}_1 
						</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						The vertex point <span class="latex"> \mathbf{p}_0  = (p_{0,x} , p_{0,y} , p_{0,z} ) </span> is in the plane containing the triangle. So the equation of the plane passing through this point can be parameterized by:
						<div class="latex" align="center">
							\mathbf{N} . (x - p_{0,x} , y - p_{0,y} , z - p_{0,z} ) = 0
						</div>
					</p>
										<p>
						This equation just says that, for any point <span class="latex"> (x, y, z) </span> on the plane, 
						the vector from this point to <span class="latex"> \mathbf{p}_0 </span> is perpendicular to the surface normal.
